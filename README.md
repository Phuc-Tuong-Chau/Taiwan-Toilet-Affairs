# Haversine Formula


Given two points on the earth's surface, with their latitudes and longitudes represented as follows:
- Point 1: $(\phi_A, \lambda_A)$
- Point 2: $(\phi_B, \lambda_B)$

The Haversine Formula is:

\[ 
a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\phi_B - \phi_A}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_A) \cdot \cos(\phi_B) \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_B - \lambda_A}{2}\right) 
\]

\[ 
c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}\left( \sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a} \right) 
\]

\[ 
d = R \cdot c 
\]

Where:
- $R$ is the earth's radius (mean radius = 6,371 km).
